Classic OXO game and recursive OXO game where the winner of the super-game is the one who wins the needed amount of sub-games so the won sub-games create a pattern
that is a winning patern in the super-game.

The simple game is a classic OXO game.
The super-game (recursive game) rules are:
1. naught player chooses first move on any board
2. crosses player makes his move on the same board
3. the square in which the crosses player made his move in step #2 determines the next board on which the naught player has to make his next move (the new board is highlighted)
4. crosses player makes his move on the same board
5. repeat step #3 (play on the board as determined by the cross player move)
6. winning one small board counts as a move by the winning player in the super-game
7. the overall winner is the super-game winner

The aim of the exercise was to use number of OOO design patterns.
